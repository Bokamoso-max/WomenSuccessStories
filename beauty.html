        <p>My Mum was never the cosmetic obsessed type at all, but a good friend of hers was in every way possible. It was this friend that gave me my first ever make up stash – she was doing a clean out of her collection and that was when I got my first MAC Russian Red. I obviously didn’t have a clue how to wear make-up and had no intention of doing that but my stash was my pride and joy, I saved up all my money to buy this huge Rimmel suitcase so I looked like a make-up artist, it came everywhere with me! My favourite hobby was doing my friends make up – I cringe to think what the result was!</p><br>

        <p>Throughout high school I continued collecting and being interested in products and dish out all sorts of beauty tips and info after reading any beauty article I could get my hands on. I even remember giving my matrics I (when I was in std 6) a hand-drawn demo on a mirror with white board markers on how a pimple develops and how to treat them (cringe, again). I also, at this stage, probably made the biggest beauty faux pas possible (as one does in their teens) – think orange, streaky self-tan, mis-matched foundation and pin-straight hair (urgh). Anyway, this all lead me to deciding to go to Isa Carstens in Stellenbosch where I studied Health & Skincare for two years. I loved all the knowledge I got from studying this course and it allowed me to work with some of the most luxurious brands whilst living in London at a company that is still one of my all-time favourites, Space NK. I learnt so much and, at this stage, was completely product obsessed; working with brands like Eve Lom, Diptyque, Kiehls, REN, Aesop, NARS to name a few – I loved understanding all the ingredients, testing, testing and testing products and learning about all the different brands’ view on skincare.</p>

        <p>I did, however, end up studying again when I returned to SA (in a completely different direction) as I never intended on being a beautician, as such, but I wanted the background knowledge and to this day it has proved invaluable (in both my blog and my work at Woolworths). So that is my little story on how I ended up having a beauty blog and why I literally cannot get enough of beauty products. It’s also why all your e-mails, tweets and messages mean so much, so thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
