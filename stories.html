                <p>I saw this post a while ago on Tanya Burr’s beauty blog and reminded myself that I have been meaning to write this post for a long time now. I get asked so often “why beauty?”, so here is my little story on why I landed up here and why I have a bathroom bursting at the seams with beauty product after beauty product. </p><br>
                <p>I actually first started loving beauty products from about the age of 11 – when I say beauty products I’m talking ‘smelly’s’ like creams, bubble baths and bath salts – I thought they were the best thing since sliced bread and soon started collecting anything and everything that could be applied to your skin and would make you smell nice. By the start of high school I had every.single.fragrance of The Body Shop butters and scrubs – all my pocket money went to this sort of thing.</p><br>

                <p>If you are in for something more dark and thought-provoking, this story is for you.
                    This is the story of two poor families that receive an offer from a rich couple to adopt one of the poor children and pay the parents generously.
                    This story is one of the more challenging stories on this list, due to its literary and older language style (19th century).

                <p>Mental health woes are endemic in South Africa, with adverse childhood experiences, socio-economic status, geographic location, age, marital status and education levels impacting the prevalence of mental illness. 
                    <br> <br>
                    A new paper by the Wits/Medical Research Council Developmental Pathways for Health Research Unit (DPHRU) titled, The prevalence of probable depression and probable anxiety, and the associations with adverse childhood experiences and socio-demographics: A National Survey in South Africa, showed that more than a quarter of South Africans suffer from probable depression with higher levels in certain provinces.
