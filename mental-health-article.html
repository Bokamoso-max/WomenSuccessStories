        <p>“Mental illness significantly impairs overall health. And, of course, Covid-19 worsened depression and anxiety, with fear, uncertainty and social and economic disruptions arising during the pandemic. Although mental health care was considered an essential service during the lockdown period in South Africa, restrictions on physical contact, in-person consultations, transport, and financial restrictions made access to facilities difficult. Thus, those seeking treatment could not access comprehensive care,” says Craig.</p>
    <h1>Early ACEs and mental health woes later</h1>
    <p>When early Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) were considered independently (apart from other socio-demographic factors like household resources and education), ACEs revealed a much greater risk for depression and anxiety later in life. A previous study shows that the likelihood of having probable depression or probable anxiety increased by 22% or 21%, respectively. This is directly proportional to the number of ACE points an individual has. <br>
        Adverse childhood experiences include physical and emotional abuse, neglect, caregiver mental illness and household violence. The more ACEs a child experiences, the more likely they will suffer from poor health in adulthood. A high risk of heart disease, diabetes, poor academic achievement and substance abuse in later life has been associated with ACE scores of four and more.</p>
        <h1>Happily ever after?  Not quite</h1>
        <p>The DPHRU study showed that older adults who are single, widowed, divorced or separated have worse mental health than those who are not. “Depression is more prevalent in later life, presumably because of a decline in health and the challenges of retirement,” says Craig.</p>
        <h1>Depression, anxiety and the urban poor</h1>
        <p>A third of the South African population and 74% of poor South Africans live in rural areas. While it is believed that individuals in more impoverished rural areas are more susceptible to experiencing mental illness, recent reports reveal that young adults in urban areas seem to experience a higher level of depression when compared to their rural counterparts. Nevertheless, the Northern Cape showed the highest rates of both probable depression and anxiety, and this province has a largely rural economy.</p>
