        <h1>I Started to Worry About Failure</h1>
        <p>I grew up in a dysfunctional household because my father was an alcoholic, and when I was young, I would lie in my twin bed next to the window and write out the life I planned to lead when I grew up and gained control. I still have the battered, sunshine-colored notebook in which I plotted my future. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Our family was working class. We had no wealth and no family connections to open doors, but the one advantage I can claim was an unwavering confidence in my ability to change my circumstance. I did not trust many people, but I trusted myself absolutely.            
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Even as a young child, I believed in my mind, my work ethic and my ambition. And so, my journal did not record my hopes for the future. It recorded what would be.
           </p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of my childhood, I have spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about all the things I would never do as a parent, all the ways I would be better. I had a determination to create the home life for my child that I wished I had growing up
                <br>
                <p>Yet before she breathed her first breath, when she was just a flutter in my stomach, I began to feel a tightness in my chest driven by a fear that I would not be up to the task. That no matter how much I loved her, I would make so many mistakes, mistakes I likely would not even know I was making, mistakes that would somehow scar my child the way that I feel scarred. The confident control I have exercised over my entire life feels so tenuous now that I am in charge of raising another human being who is witnessing me and all of my flaws while her personhood is being formed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Even as I now have more empathy for my own parents, I am consumed by the fear that in the most important venture in my life, I will fail. So when my daughter was just a baby, I started writing a journal to her. Over pages and pages, I tell her how much I love her, how much she means to me, how she has changed my life, and own up when I make mistakes.
