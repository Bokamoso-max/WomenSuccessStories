        date:"Jun 13, 2024 ",
        p1:"Getting There: Although it’s a bit remote, getting to the North Cape is pretty straightforward once you get to Norway. You’ll want to get to Alta (the one in Norway, not Alta in Utah which is also great for hiking by the way) and from there you can either take a bus or rent a car. A drive from Alta to North Cape takes roughly 3-4 hours but keep in mind the weather can change rapidly and potentially slow you down.",
        p2:"What To Do: The North Cape is where you want to be outdoors but to best enjoy it, make sure you dress appropriately. Summers are generally chilly while some days climate change shines and it can get quite warm. Take a look at any given 7 day forecast and you’ll be taken on a roller coaster of icons with plenty of precipitation possible on any given day.",
        p3:"North Cape Norway Costs: Norway is expensive there’s no other way to put it. There are ways though you can travel to North Cape on a budget as Hege explains in the episode. For a unique experience up in the Arctic circle with plenty of hopping off points around Norway, North Cape might just be the perfect next destination for you with family or as part of a solo trip.",

        p1:"Where is Mount Kilimanjaro Located?: Mount Kilimanjaro is situated in northeastern Tanzania, near the border with Kenya. Its majestic peak rises above the surrounding plains, commanding the attention of all who behold it. The nearest major city to Kilimanjaro is Arusha, a popular starting point for many Kilimanjaro treks.",
        p2:"How to Get There: The most common way to reach Kilimanjaro is by flying into Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO), located approximately 46 kilometers (29 miles) from Arusha. Several international airlines offer direct flights to Kilimanjaro Airport from major cities in Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of Africa. Upon arrival, you can arrange transportation to your accommodation in Arusha, where your Kilimanjaro adventure will begin.",
        p3:"When is the Best Time to Climb: Late December to early March and mid-June to late October are the best times for a Kilimanjaro climb. This is when the Kilimanjaro weather is nearly ideal. Seven days is the ideal duration of the expedition.",

        date:"December 14, 2023",
        p1:"In the 1920s the southern line in Thailand connected to Malaya and travel was popular by train between Bangkok and Singapore. In the days before sleeper carriages, passengers would stop in local guesthouses, later replaced by railway hotels. International travel by train from Thailand has become quite disjointed lately, so I decided to try the journey from Singapore to Bangkok – not by the Eastern & Oriental Express, but using everyday trains.",
        p2:"I have to confess to flying down to Singapore, and after an interesting night in Chinatown I met up with my travel partner for this adventure, Richard Barrow. Richard was an indispensable part of the trip as he managed to get nearly all the tickets in advance.",
        p3:"In a strange feature of international relations, Singapore did not own or operate its own railway. The two stations on the island were operated by KTM, the Malaysian railway until 2011. Today the two historic stations of Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar are preserved, but no longer operational. The challenge at the start of this journey is leaving Singapore. Today there is no direct train service, you have to get a five minute shuttle train from Woodlands across the causeway to JB Town (Johor Bahru). This isn’t as easy as might be, as it is busy and gets sold out, so you have to buy tickets well in advance.",

        title:"Lets Talk About Borderline Personality Disorder",
        img:"MentalHealth1.jpg",
        author:"CAITLIN JOHNSON",
        date:"SEPTEMBER 11, 2018",
        p1:"The intention of this post is to talk about my diagnosis. I think I’m mainly going to discuss my thoughts and feelings surrounding the reality of being diagnosed with “Borderline Personality Disorder” (BPD), especially the ones I felt when I was first diagnosed but we’ll see how it goes. This post has been the hardest to write so far. I’m not sure which aspects to focus on or what message I want to get across but anyway, I hope it is still insightful.",
        p2:"I use the “” when I write the diagnosis because I don’t quite agree with the name of it. What I feel the name says to those who know nothing about it, is that the person suffering has a ‘disordered personality’; there’s something ‘wrong’ with it and therefore with them as a person. Your personality is pretty much who you are and to have a label attached to it which basically calls it ‘disordered’ is a bit shitty to be honest. It’s not really surprising that there’s still a huge stigma attached to the “personality disorder” illnesses and I feel the name contributes to a large part of it.  I do NOT have a disordered personality, I am NOT flawed and my diagnosis does NOT define me as a person; it is NOT who I am.",
        p3:"Things have, however, changed slightly! BPD is now also known as “Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder” (EUPD) which admittedly does get shot of the outdated ‘borderline’ part of the name but, the ‘personality disorder’ is still present, therefore not changing much in my opinion. I believe that the connotations of the phrase ’emotionally unstable’ are still mostly negative and further contribute to the stigma. It is often debated that the ‘PD’ should be dropped completely. I’ve mentioned it in a previous post that BPD is thought to stem from trauma in childhood and therefore should be named something which reflects the trauma it is caused by. I tend to agree.",

        date:"13TH FEBRUARY 2017",
        p1:"So you’ve been diagnosed with a Social Anxiety Disorder and you quickly realise how many people just think you’re “a bit shy” or using it as an excuse or even using it to get sympathy or attention. Does that sound about right? That’s if you’ve even told anyone you have it of course because let’s face it, that’s not an easy thing to do when you have social anxiety.It might even get dismissed by some people as a “teenage thing” or a phase you’ll get over but we both know that’s a sack of crap, don’t we?",
        p2:"Having a Social Anxiety Disorder is far more serious than being a bit shy, having stomach jitters or going through an awkward teen phase. It can severely affect your day-to-day life. So much that you may find it extremely difficult to go to school or work, make friends and maintain friendships, do typical daily tasks that require being out of the house or in public, use the telephone, have a conversation, be seen outdoors, go to events/parties, try new things… shit, even having the smallest of responsibilities can fuck you up. It can be hard telling people what social anxiety really feels like because it’s often confusing and complex to us",
        p3:"Obviously social anxiety affects everyone in different ways and something that one person may find difficult may not be the same for another person with social anxiety, we may not all be triggered the same way or have the same level of severity but one thing is for sure, if we don’t treat it or get a handle on it, it can stop us from living our lives properly.",

        p1:"If you’ve been diagnosed with a mental illness then you’ve probably been told a million times that it’s good to talk.Being open and honest with your partner, family and friends is definitely a step in the right direction as keeping your feeling bottled up is a recipe for disaster.",
        p2:"But the truth is sometimes your nearest and dearest – no matter how hard the try – don’t always say the right thing, because they’re not trained in how to deal with your illness.",
        p3:"That’s when talking to a professional counsellor can really help, because you can get more than just comfort and reassurance – you can actually learn the skills to get better.",
